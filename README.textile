This is my attemt to port the code examples from "Programming Collective Intelligence" by Toby Segaran from O'Reilly to ruby.
I am using the book as a guide to learn ruby and to get a better understanding of the algorithms presented in the book.
I am not a ruby expert so I am not sure if the code is idiomatic ruby or not.

I try not to stupidly port the stuff but also try to use ruby idioms and best practices wherevever possible.
I also try to keep the code as close to the original as possible, so that it is easy to compare the two implementations.
h2. Status

* Chapter 2
** Euclidean Distance Score - finished
** Pearson-Coefficient - finished
** Ranking aka top_matches - finished
** Recommendations - finished _(recommendations with sim_distance somehow returns different values (but in correct order) - need to investigate)_
** Finding Products (transforming) - finished

h2. Errata

(a short collection of errors I encountered on my way through the book - if not stated otherwise, they are also present in the official oreilly errata collection.)

* Chapter 2
** Both example code AND result from the euclidean distance score are broken. The code in the book contains syntax errors (and the given similarity score for Lisa Rose and Gene Seymour is wrong). The example code from the website misses out the final sqrt() on the sums, but delivers, tadaa, the wrong result contained in the book.
